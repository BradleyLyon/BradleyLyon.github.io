        A Ride to a New Me
      </h1>
        <p class="essay">
            All around me, there are eyes. Eyes that seem to follow every sentence of my internal monologue, gazing at the carefully crafted rules and structure that go into my every action. They see me, not just the facade I have so meticulously crafted as a means for self-preservation in a school that thrives on gossip and rumor. This eccentric culture is only made worse by the complete evaporation of its significance the moment we step out of the school doors. It is the breaking of such internal rules that has led to where I am now, in a room full of onlookers who whisper and stare, none polite enough as to refrain from their gazing, yet none confident enough in their conviction as to dare make eye contact.
            Deep breath in,
            and out.
            Deep breath in,
            and out.
            I walk out. Out of the classroom that confines not only my body, but also my spirit. I walk away, through hallways that are filled with memories of fake smiles and fake promises. I walk past the security guard who never even bothers to lift her head when students pass by. Six blocks to go, six blocks until I am allowed to be myself again. Past the Westside Theater, filled with tech crew and aspiring improvisers who chat away about the latest musicals. Four blocks left. Past McCaffrey Playground, where a group of men play basketball, shouting basketball terms that might as well be another language to me. Two blocks left. Through Times Square, filled with travelers, each with their own day of traveling and exploring ahead of them. Finally, I see it, the entrance to the Port Authority Bus Terminal; my gateway to my true self, 472 subway stops, endless in their granting of possibilities for personal exploration.
            42nd Street is the heart of NYC, pumping people around the city like cells into a system of arteries and veins. As people step onto the train and say goodbye to their family, coworkers, or even close friends, they let their masks fall off, awaiting their next destination as the energy to maintain their characters slowly drains out of them. Like oxygen from a cell, they are taken all around NYC, defining themselves differently at each location. The heart pumps fresh blood all around NYC, maintaining the complex systems that allow us to be anywhere and with anyone we want. Everyones’ body of NYC is different. The lungs of my city are my home, bringing fresh air and energy back to me after all my oxygen has been drained. But more important than the lungs, is the pulmonary artery, the artery connecting my heart to my lungs. For me, that is the R line. I belong to Union Street, one of the worst subway stations when it rains. It is known to my family as “The Station of Atlantis.” While at 42nd Street I am a nervous high school student on his way home from another day of torment. At Union Street I can be anyone I want to be. It is my home away from home. It is the start of most of my travels. I think of who I want to be as I get on the train, the details of my character coming to me like pieces of a blank puzzle, never knowing if they'll fit until I try them out. As I ride on the R line, from Union Street to any of the other major stops, I am transformed into a new me, expressing myself in whatever way I want to or need to.
            Although I must have known at least 100 people at Beacon High School, not once have I seen any of them since the day I left. As I ride to Nest+m High School, six months later, I realize the ride I used to make is gone. The stress and anxiety that would build as I rode across the Brooklyn Bridge, listing all the names of people I would try to avoid that day, is gone. My role as a helpless and anxiety ridden spectacle slowly encompassing my body as the train plummeted from the bright bridge top into the dark chasm that is the R line. Today is the start of a new ride, my chin held high and my back straight with a perfect thoracic and lumbar curve. My voice a blend of confidence and humbleness, my clothing not too excessive to be noticed but not too bland as to come off as boring. At Nest+m, I can restart. I can be whoever I want to be.
            Each time I ride on the subway, Q to the B, A to the R, G to the F, or C to the D, I am transformed each minute I ride. The sound of the train guiding me to somewhere new. R to the F to pursue academic excellence. But, on Saturday nights, when I stop being a straight-A student with no social life, I take the 2-3 line. On Friday nights, movie nights with my childhood friends, I take the B train 2 stops, embracing childhood jokes and a light-hearted sense of humor. When spring comes around and, with it, climate marches and school strikes, I take the Q train, passion and conviction rising in me as the train fills with those that have the same destination as me. Despite living in the city my whole life, exploring parts of myself I never would have known could exist, I have never taken the 7 train, nor the L train or the E train. There is so much city left for me to explore, so many new parts of myself to discover. Things I will never get to know exist until I take a ride and step out of a new station and into a new perspective.
            Each person on the train is there for a different reason. Their body of NYC has different veins and arteries connecting their memories and core locations. Taking different trains, becoming different people with each ride. On the train, we are no one; on the train, we are anyone. When I step into Union Street at 7:55 every morning, I am pumped into the system, transformed line by line as I jump between ideas, feelings, personalities and cultures. I will never explore all of NYC, I will never explore all of the potential for who I am.
